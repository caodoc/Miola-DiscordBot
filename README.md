# Miola Bot

## Introduction
A discord bot made with [disnake](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/) python library.

Bot template by [@GlowCheese](https://github.com/GlowCheese), modified by me.

## Usage
Replace ``BOT_TOKEN`` and ``OWNER_ID`` at ``constants.py`` into your bot's token and your discord's ID.

Run ``bot.py`` on terminal by ``py bot.py``, that's all.
